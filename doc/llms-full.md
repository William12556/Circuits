       Requirements

## Board Layout

*Board Layout*

**type**CAD can help with board layout. Component locations can be set in code and then reused.

## Recommended workflow

1. If you're using a **type**CAD package that includes a board layout
2. `import` and configure as usual
3. At the end of the main file, include the package's components in `PCB::create(...package.components)`.
4. Call `PCB::create();` to generate the KiCAD board file.

When you open the board in KiCAD, you'll see the components placed.

## `PCB`

Here is the minimal code to create a PCB.

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad';
let pcb = new PCB('typecad_docs');

// add components to the PCB
pcb.create();
```

After running the code, there will be a `typecad_docs.kicad_pcb` file in `./build`.

## PCB Coordinates

Each `Component` has a `pcb` property that contains `{x, y, rotation}`. That's how the component's location is specified. You can take them directly from KiCAD when you're finished laying out the components.

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad';
import { Resistor } from '@typecad/passives/0805';

let pcb = new PCB('typecad_docs');
let r1 = new Resistor({ value: '1kohm', reference: 'R1' });

r1.pcb = { x: 10, y: 10, rotation: 0 }; // [!code highlight]
pcb.create();
```

## Group or Place Components

In KiCAD, you can group components together. They will move around together when you click and drag anywhere in the group. There is also a labeled box around the components.

To accomplish this for a group of related components:

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad';
import { Resistor } from '@typecad/passives/0805';

let r1 = new Resistor({ value: '1kohm', reference: 'R1' });
let pcb = new PCB('typecad_docs');

r1.pcb = { x: 10, y: 10, rotation: 0 };
pcb.group('typecad_docs', r1); // [!code highlight]
pcb.create();
```

Or to place them:

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad';
import { Resistor } from '@typecad/passives/0805';

let r1 = new Resistor({ value: '1kohm', reference: 'R1' });
let pcb = new PCB('typecad_docs');

r1.pcb = { x: 10, y: 10, rotation: 0 };
pcb.group('typecad_docs', r1); // [!code --]
pcb.place(r1); // [!code ++]
pcb.create();
```

## Vias

Vias can be created, placed and connected like any other component. Vias are connected through `pin(1)`.

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad';
import { Resistor } from '@typecad/passives/0805';

let typecad = new PCB('typecad_docs');
let r1 = new Resistor({ value: '1kohm' });

// create a via with a diameter of 0.6mm and a drill size of 0.3mm
let via = typecad.via({
  at: { x: 10, y: 10 },
  size: 0.6,
  drill: 0.3,
  powerInfo: { current: 1, maxTempRise: 5, thickness: 35 },
});

// connect the resistor and via together
typecad.net(r1.pin(1), via.pin(1));

// group it
typecad.group('typecad_docs', r1, via);

// create it like any other component
typecad.create(r1, via);
```

### Power aware

Vias can be created with the optional `powerInfo` object. This allows **type**CAD to check that the current draw through the via is within the limits of the via's rating using the IPC-2221 standard. `maxTempRise` is the maximum wanted rise in temperature of the via, default is 10 C. `thickness` is the thickness of the via's copper in microns. 35 is the default (1 oz).

## Outlines

Board outlines can be created.

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad';

let pcb = new PCB('typecad_docs');

// create an outline x=100, y=100, width=50, height=50, with a corner fillet of 1mm
pcb.outline(100, 100, 50, 50, 1);

pcb.create();
```

_The corner fillet is optional and can be omitted._

## Tracks

Tracks are created using the `TrackBuilder` object.

```ts
import { PCB, TrackBuilder } from '@typecad/typecad';

let pcb = new PCB('typecad_docs');

let power_track: TrackBuilder = this.pcb
  .track()
  .powerInfo({ current: 1.0, maxTempRise: 10, thickness: 35 }) // optional power information
  .from({ x: 100, y: 100 }, 'F.Cu', 0.2) // Start on F.Cu, 0.2mm wide (these are the defaults and can be omitted)
  .to({ x: 110, y: 100 }) // go to 110, 100
  .via({ size: 0.8, drill: 0.4 }) // create a via at 110, 100
  .to({ x: 110, y: 120, layer: 'B.Cu' }); // Continues on B.Cu

pcb.group('typecad_docs', power_track); // add the TrackBuilder to the group

pcb.create();
```

Using the above method, tracks can be created by going from point to point, using vias to transition between layers. Nets and connections are not required to be specified. KiCAD will connect any track that touches an element with a net, ie. a track that touches a pad connected to the 'gnd' net will make the entire track also connected to the 'gnd' net.

### Power aware

`TrackBuilder` objects can be created with the optional `powerInfo` object. This allows **type**CAD to check that the current draw through the track is within the limits of the track's rating using the IPC-2221 standard. `maxTempRise` is the maximum wanted rise in temperature of the track, default is 10 C. `thickness` is the thickness of the track's copper in microns. 35 is the default (1 oz).

> [!note] There is an easier way
> [@typecad/kicad2typecad](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typecad/kicad2typecad) is a command-line tool that can be used to convert a KiCAD board file into **type**CAD code snippets. It will give component locations, TrackBuilder objects and vias.
> This is particularly useful for [package](/docs/package/overview) creation. You can lay out the entire package in KiCAD; components placed, tracks drawn, and vias added. Then use `kicad2typecad` to generate the code snippets to create them programmatically in the package.

---

## Classes

*Classes*

## `PCB`

The main class that represents the entire circuit.

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad';
let typecad = new PCB('typecad_concepts', {thickness: 1.6, copper_thickness: 35 });
```

The only required option is the name. The name determines the name of the resulting KiCAD files (.net and .kicad_pcb).

Optional properties are: `{thickness: 1.6, copper_thickness: 35 }`
- thickness — board thickness in mm
- copper_thickness — copper thickness in microns (1 oz = 35 microns)

These are used in power-aware calculations.

The `PCB` class is where:
- Components are added
- Connections are made between components
- utility functions like ERC and BOM

## `Component`

The `Component` class represents individual parts like resistors, capacitors, ICs, etc. You add a `Component` to your `PCB`.

```ts
import { Component } from '@typecad/typecad';

let R1 = new Component({ value: '1kohm' });
```

Options for the `Component` class are:

- _reference_ — reference designator
- _value_ — value of component
- _footprint_ — footprint
- _prefix_ — prefix for reference designator
- _datasheet_ — link to component datasheet
- _description_ — description of component
- _voltage_ — voltage rating of component
- _wattage_ — wattage rating of component
- _mpn_ — Manufacturer Part Number
- _dnp_ — true if component is Do Not Populate, false to place component
- _simulation_ — an object with simulation data `{ include: true, model: 'ngspice-model' }`

> [!note] Syntax
> **type**CAD makes use of the above syntax style for many of its classes, ie. passing an object of optional properties. *Optional* in terms of TypeScript code, if a particular property isn't passed and **type**CAD requires it, it will throw an error during build. 

## `Power`

Represents a power source like a battery or voltage regulator. 

```ts
import { Power } from '@typecad/typecad';

let coin_cell = new Power({ power: holder.pin(1), gnd: holder.pin(2), voltage: 3.7 });
```

Options are:

- _power_ — pin on a component that supplies power
- _gnd_ — pin on a component that supplies ground
- _voltage_ — voltage of power source

       Passives

---

## Components

*Components*

In the [passives](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typecad/passives) package, components are created with a couple properties that have been predetermined:

- footprint
- prefix

Doing that takes some of the effort out of creating common components. But all it was really doing was calling the `Component` class with a few properties already set.

## `Component`

The `Component` class is the base class for all components in **type**CAD. A component is anything added to the board. In KiCAD, it would be anything that has a footprint file associated with it.

```ts
import { Component } from '@typecad/typecad';

let u1 = new Component({ footprint: 'Package_SO:SOIC-8_5.3x5.3mm_P1.27mm' });
```

The above creates a SOIC-8 component. `footprint` is the KiCAD footprint path and split into two strings.

That method works well for simple components, but there is a better way using the `add-component` tool.

## `npx @typecad/add-component`

**type**CAD has a command line tool that can be used to create a component. It is in your project's `package.json` file, you can simply click the `Add Component` button in the VSCode GUI under `NPM Scripts`. If you're not using VSCode, you can run `npx @typecad/add-component --folder=./src` from the `./hw` directory of your project.

The script will ask where the component is coming from, either the KiCAD library, a local file, or an EasyEDA/JLCPCB component.

If you're using the KiCAD library, you'll be asked for the symbol library and name. Paste it in, press enter and it should automatically figure out which footprint to use. If it can't, it will ask you for a footprint library name and footprint name (library.kicad_mod:footprint).

If you're using a local file, you'll be asked for the path to the symbol file and footprint file.

If it's an [EasyEDA/JLCPCB component](https://jlcpcb.com/parts), you'll be asked for the `C###` number.

### KiCAD Library Components

If you'll be creating a component that is in the KiCAD library, you need two pieces of information:

- footprint library name
- component footprint name

Right now, the easiest way to get that information is to add the part you want to a schematic. For this example, we'll make an ATtiny85 MCU so add it to a KiCAD schematic. Select it and press `e`. You should see a dialog that looks like this:

![KiCAD Symbol Properties](/docs/attiny85.png)

The highlighted `Library link` text on the bottom has the information you need. The first part, before the `:` is the symbol library name (`MCU_Microchip_ATtiny`), the second part is the symbol name (`ATtiny85-20S`).

> [!important]
> Making components is the only point in **type**CAD where you need to deal with KiCAD symbols. It uses the information in them to create some boilerplate code for you.

### Local File Components

If you're creating a component that is not in the KiCAD library, you need the symbol file (.kicad_sym) and footprint file (.kicad_mod) for the component. It is easiest to copy the files to your project directory. They can be deleted after the component is created.

### EasyEDA/JLCPCB Component

If you are working within JLC's ecosystem for design or assembly, you can use the `C###` numbers of their parts to create a component. The footprint and 3d model will be downloaded and a **type**CAD component will be created.

> [!WARNING]
> The parts are converted from EasyEDA's format to KiCAD's footprint. The conversion isn't always perfect. The most common issue is pin types being `unspecified` rather than what they should actually be.

### Component Use

After the component is created, they'll be some code in the terminal that tells you how to `import` it and declare a `new` instance of it. For the ATtiny85, it will look like this:

```bash
# [!code word:import]
# [!code word:new]
🧩 typeCAD Create Component
✔ Component source? KiCAD
✔ Symbol name? MCU_Microchip_ATtiny:ATtiny3227-M
✔ Footprint name? Package_DFN_QFN:QFN-24-1EP_4x4mm_P0.5mm_EP2.6x2.6mm
Finished component creation, use it with:
 import { ATtiny85_20S } from './ATtiny85_20S';
 let u1 = new ATtiny85_20S();
```

Let's look at what's in the `ATtiny85_20S.ts` file that was created to get a better idea of what is going on.

### `ATtiny85_20S.ts`

```ts
import { Component, Pin } from '@typecad/typecad';
/**
 | Pin # | Name         | Type              |
 | --:   | :--          | :--               |
 | 8     | VCC          | power_in          |
 | 4     | GND          | power_in          |
 | 5     | AREF_PB0     | bidirectional     |
 | 6     | PB1          | bidirectional     |
 | 7     | PB2          | bidirectional     |
 | 2     | XTAL1_PB3    | bidirectional     |
 | 3     | XTAL2_PB4    | bidirectional     |
 | 1     | _RESET_PB5   | bidirectional     |
 */
export class ATtiny85_20S extends Component {
  VCC = new Pin(this.reference, 8, 'power_in', this, {
    minimum_voltage: -0.5,
    maximum_voltage: 6,
    current: 0.2,
  });
  GND = new Pin(this.reference, 4, 'power_in', this, {
    minimum_voltage: -0.5,
    maximum_voltage: 6,
    current: 0.2,
  });
  AREF_PB0 = new Pin(this.reference, 5, 'bidirectional', this, {
    minimum_voltage: -0.5,
    maximum_voltage: 6,
    current: 0.04,
  });
  PB1 = new Pin(this.reference, 6, 'bidirectional', this, {
    minimum_voltage: -0.5,
    maximum_voltage: 6,
    current: 0.04,
  });
  PB2 = new Pin(this.reference, 7, 'bidirectional', this, {
    minimum_voltage: -0.5,
    maximum_voltage: 6,
    current: 0.04,
  });
  XTAL1_PB3 = new Pin(this.reference, 2, 'bidirectional', this, {
    minimum_voltage: -0.5,
    maximum_voltage: 6,
    current: 0.04,
  });
  XTAL2_PB4 = new Pin(this.reference, 3, 'bidirectional', this, {
    minimum_voltage: -0.5,
    maximum_voltage: 6,
    current: 0.04,
  });
  _RESET_PB5 = new Pin(this.reference, 1, 'bidirectional', this, {
    minimum_voltage: -0.5,
    maximum_voltage: 13,
    current: 0.04,
  });

  constructor(reference?: string | undefined) {
    super({ reference, footprint: 'Package_SO:SOIC-8_5.3x5.3mm_P1.27mm' });
  }
}
```

It is a bit more involved than the simple TypeScript we've been using so far (that's why it was auto-generated). But it helps to explain what is going on.

The file `extends` the `Component` by adding some extras to it. In particular, it adds `Pin` objects to the component. Rather than using the pins like `u1.pin(1)`, we can use `u1.VCC` for the VCC pin, or `u1.GND` for the GND pin. This makes the code much easier to read and understand.

`minimum_voltage`, `maximum_voltage`, and `current` are optional and provide additional information for the power-aware system to check trace widths, and ensure voltage/current restrictions are met. 

## `add`

After a `Component` has been created and modified, call `add` to include it in the schematic and netlist.

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad';
import { ATtiny85_20S } from './ATtiny85_20S';

let typecad = new PCB('typecad_docs');
let u1 = new ATtiny85_20S();

typecad.add(u1);        // method 1
// --or--
typecad.create(u1, ...);    // method 2
```

The `add` method adds the component explicitly and the `::create(...)` method adds them all at once just prior to building. Functionally, there is no difference, but if a components are being created dynamically, it is useful to have a method to add them.

## Concepts

*Concepts*

Instead of using the KiCAD schematic editor, you write code and then build it into a KiCAD schematic.

**type**CAD uses TypeScript. You don't need an extensive knowledge of TypeScript to get started. 

If you're familiar with any programming language, you can pick up the basics of TypeScript pretty quickly. 

> [!faq]- Why TypeScript?
> One of the long-term goals of **type**CAD was to integrate hardware design into the realm of AI. Most AI-based tools understand TypeScript very well and don't need special training to use it effectively.
> TypeScript is also relatively simple to learn and use. 

## KiCAD
The normal flow in KiCAD is:
1. Create a project with a schematic and board
2. Add components
3. Make connections
4. Layout the board

## **type**CAD
**type**CAD replaces steps 1-3. Instead of clicking and dragging to place components and make connections, TypeScript code is used. 

This is how a PCB is created.

```ts 
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad';
let typecad = new PCB('typecad');
typecad.create();
```

That code will create a KiCAD board file in `./build/typecad.kicad_pcb`.

### Build
**type**CAD projects have a build process. It takes the TypeScript code and turns it into a KiCAD project. The code you write, plus the **type**CAD API simply runs itself and the result is the KiCAD project. 

### Workflow
The new layout becomes:
1. Create a **type**CAD project
2. Edit the code to add components and make connections
3. Build it
4. Open the board in KiCAD to layout

       Tooling

## Connections

*Connections*

In **type**CAD, connections are created by calling the `Schematic::net()` function. Connections are made between components in the same `Schematic`. 

The `net()` function takes a list of `Pin` objects.

## ❌ Common Mistakes

**WRONG**: Pins do not have a `.connect()` method

```ts
// ❌ This will NOT work
esp32.pin('VDD').connect(vcc);
cap1.pin('1').connect(vcc);
```

**✅ CORRECT**: Use `typecad.net()` to connect pins

```ts
// ✅ This is the correct way
typecad.net(esp32.VDD, cap1.pin(1));
// or with named nets
typecad.named('VCC').net(esp32.VDD, cap1.pin(1));
```

## Connecting Pins
Let's add a decoupling capacitor to the ATtiny85 example we've been working with.

```ts
import { Capacitor } from '@typecad/passives/0805'// [!code highlight]
import { ATtiny85_20S } from './ATtiny85_20S';
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad';

let typecad = new PCB('typecad_docs');
let u1 = new ATtiny85_20S();
let c1 = new Capacitor({ value: '1uF' });// [!code highlight]

typecad.net(u1.VCC, c1.pin(1));     // power [!code highlight]
typecad.net(u1.GND, c1.pin(2));     // ground [!code highlight]
```

We've connected pin 1 of the capacitor to the VCC pin of the ATtiny85 and pin 2 to the GND pin.

`::net()` takes any number of `Pin` objects, so you can connect multiple pins at once.

### Named Connections
Sometimes it is useful to name the connection. The net name will be visible in KiCAD, it can be useful when laying out the board. Some **type**CAD utility functions will only pay attention to named connections as well. If you don't name the connection, it will be `net#`.

```ts
typecad.net(u1.VCC, c1.pin(1)); // [!code --]
typecad.named('power').net(u1.VCC, c1.pin(1)); // [!code ++]
```

The connection in KiCAD will now be labled `power`.

## Common Connection Patterns

### Power Distribution
Connect multiple components to the same power rail:

```ts
// Power distribution pattern
typecad.named('VCC').net(
  microcontroller.VDD,
  cap1.pin(1),
  cap2.pin(1),
  connector.pin(1)
);
```

### Ground Distribution
Connect multiple ground pins together:

```ts
// Ground distribution pattern  
typecad.named('GND').net(
  microcontroller.GND,
  microcontroller.GND_2,  // if component has multiple ground pins
  cap1.pin(2),
  cap2.pin(2),
  connector.pin(2)
);
```

### Signal Connections
Connect signal pins between components:

```ts
// Signal connections
typecad.named('SDA').net(microcontroller.PB0, sensor.SDA);
typecad.named('SCL').net(microcontroller.PB1, sensor.SCL);
```

## Power Objects vs Named Nets

**Use Power objects** when you have an actual power source component:

```ts
let battery = new Power({ voltage: 3.3 });  // represents actual battery/regulator
```

**Use named nets** for power distribution (most common):

```ts
typecad.named('VCC').net(/* pins */);  // just connecting existing power pins
typecad.named('GND').net(/* pins */);  // just connecting existing ground pins
```

> [!WARNING]
> **type**CAD merges nets with similar `Pin` connections. If you make a connection to an already connected pin, that newer net will be merged into the existing net. This will mean your `named` net may not keep the name you give it if it is merged with another net later. You'll see a warning in the build output if this happens. 

       Board Layout

## Package Code

*Code*

Now that we've created a package, we need to know how to use it. 

## Self-documenting
A benefit of TypeScript is that you can write a lot of documentation in the code itself. You'll notice the JSDoc comments in the package code. This will result in VSCode hints and tips as you write the code, explaining parameters and providing examples if fully implemented. 

## Copying files
Refer to the [structure](../package/structure) section for the file structure of a package, particularly the `postinstall.js` file. KiCAD expects symbols and footprints to be in the `./build` directory, but we haven't actually `npm install`ed the package, so those files will need to be manually copied there. 

## `import`
The tooling gave us the `import` statement for the package.

```ts
import { typecad_package } from "./typecad_package";
```

## `new`
Now create a new instance of the package.

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad';
import { typecad_package } from "./typecad_package";
import * as _0805 from '@typecad/passives/0805'

let typecad = new PCB('typecad_docs');
let u1 = new typecad_package({ pcb: typecad });                           // pcb is required
let u1 = new typecad_package({ pcb: typecad, reference: 'U1' });          // specify the reference designator
let u1 = new typecad_package({ pcb: typecad, passives: _0805 });          // change passives to 0805
```

## Connections
After creating the instance, you'll probably want to connect the package's components to something. You can access the pins of any component in the package.

```ts
u1.U1.GND // the ground pin of the ATtiny3227
u1.U1.VCC // the power pin of the ATtiny3227
```

## Include the package
After the package has been pulled in with an `import` and a `new` instance created, configuration is done, and connections made, you `create` it to the schematic.

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad';
import { typecad_package } from "./typecad_package";
let typecad = new PCB('typecad_docs');

let u1 = new typecad_package({ pcb: typecad });

typecad.create(...u1.components);
```

The package's components will be added to the PCB. 

## Do Not Populate
If a package includes a component you don't want included in the netlist or layout:

```ts
let u1 = new typecad_package({ schematic: typecad });
u1.U1.dnp = true;
```

---

## Passives

*Passives*

To simplify adding components, the most common components: resistors, capacitors, etc, have been packaged into [@typecad/passives](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typecad/passives). It is automatically installed when a project is created.

## Package Import Reference

| Component Type | Package | Import Example |
|----------------|---------|----------------|
| Resistors, Capacitors, LEDs, Diodes | `@typecad/passives/0603` | `import { Resistor, Capacitor } from '@typecad/passives/0603'` |
| Same components, different sizes | `@typecad/passives/0805` | `import { Resistor, Capacitor } from '@typecad/passives/0805'` |
| Connectors | `@typecad/passives/connector` | `import { Connector } from '@typecad/passives/connector'` |
| Test Points | `@typecad/passives/testpoint` | `import { Testpoint } from '@typecad/passives/testpoint'` |

## Sizes
The [@typecad/passives](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typecad/passives) package is organized by component size.

```ts
import { Resistor, LED, Capacitor, Diode, Inductor, Fuse } from '@typecad/passives/0805'

let r1 = new Resistor({ value: '1kohm', reference: 'R1' });
```

Will import all the components in the 0805 size.

To import 0603 components, use:

```ts
import { Resistor, LED, Capacitor, Diode, Inductor, Fuse } from '@typecad/passives/0603'// [!code word:0603:1]
```

All of the sizes are:

- @typecad/passives/1210
- @typecad/passives/1206
- @typecad/passives/0805
- @typecad/passives/0603
- @typecad/passives/0402
- @typecad/passives/0201 **no fuses*

### Multi-sizes
To import multiple sizes, use this `import` statement syntax:

```ts
// [!code word:* as _0603]
// [!code word:* as _0805]
import * as _0603 from '@typecad/passives/0603'
import * as _0805 from '@typecad/passives/0805'

let r1 = new _0603.Resistor({ value: '1kohm' }); 
let c2 = new _0805.Capacitor({ value: '1uF' });
```

> [!tip]
> `_0603` and `_0805` can be changed to any TypeScript-legal name.

## Reference Designators
KiCAD tracks components by their reference designator. This is the name that appears on the schematic and the PCB. In the `passives` package, the `reference` property is how components are referenced. It is not a required property of any `passives` component, if it is not passed, one will automatically generated.

Auto-generation works as follows:
- if `reference` is passed, it will be used. If there is a name conflict, it will be renamed and a warning will be logged in the build output.
- if `reference` is not passed, it will create one using the `prefix` property and an internal counter by type of component. ie the first resistor will be `R1`, the second resistor will be `R2`, etc. 
- if the `prefix` property is not passed, it will be `R` by default for resistors, `C` for capacitors, `L` for inductors, etc.

> [!warning]
> Because ultimately, KiCAD is tracking components by reference designator, components will sometimes swap reference designators with eachother based on when the **type**CAD build process encounters it during the build process. This only happens when a similar component is created before an already laid-out component. 

## Unique Footprints
Sometimes, passive components will have a unique footprint. To use that footprint with this package:
1. copy the footprint file (.kicad_mod) into ./hw/src/build/lib/footprints
2. use it in your `new` component:

```ts
import { Inductor } from '@typecad/passives/0805'
let l1 = new Inductor({ value: '1uH', footprint: 'unique_inductor_footprint' });
```

       Components

## Pins

*Pins*

In **type**CAD, the `Pin` object represents the pin/leg/lead/ball etc. of a component. 

## Pin Access Methods

There are two ways to access pins in **type**CAD:

### Numeric Pin Access: `component.pin(number)`
Use this for simple components like passives where pin numbers are straightforward:

```ts
import { Resistor } from '@typecad/passives/0805'
let r1 = new Resistor({ value: '1kohm' });

r1.pin(1);      // first pin
r1.pin(2);      // second pin
```

### Named Pin Access: `component.PINNAME`
Use this for complex components (ICs, connectors) where pins have descriptive names:

```ts
import { ATtiny85_20S } from './ATtiny85_20S';
let u1 = new ATtiny85_20S();

u1.VCC      // power pin (internally pin 8)
u1.GND      // ground pin (internally pin 4)
u1.PB0      // GPIO pin PB0
```

**When to use each:**
- **Passives** (resistors, capacitors, LEDs): Use `component.pin(1)`, `component.pin(2)`
- **ICs and complex components**: Use named pins like `component.VCC`, `component.GND`
- **Connectors**: Can use either `connector.pin(1)` or named pins if defined

## Power aware
Each `Pin` object has a `powerInfo` object that can be optionally passed when creating the `Pin`. It has the following properties:
- `minimum_voltage` — minimum voltage the pin can tolerate
- `maximum_voltage` — maximum voltage the pin can tolerate
- `current` — maximum current the pin can handle

When pins have the object passed with data, **type**CAD can check that the voltage levels and current draw are compatible with each other. 

```ts
  VCC = new Pin(this.reference, 8, 'power_in', this, {
    minimum_voltage: -0.5,
    maximum_voltage: 6,
    current: 0.2,
  });
```
`VCC` can accept -0.5 to 6 volts and supply up to 0.2 amps. When connected to other pins, **type**CAD can check that the voltage and current levels are compatible and issue error or warning messages if the voltage is too high or the current draw is too much.

       Power

---

## Power

*Power*

A `Power` object is extra information that is used for:
- ERC: by setting `Pin` types to `power_out` or `power_in`
- voltage compatibility checks

Another thing that is important to know is that `Power` is not the equivalent of a power or ground symbol on a schematic. A `Power` object represents a physical set of pins, not an abstract concept of power or ground. 

## Output `Power`

An output `Power` object defines a source of electrical power within your design.

```ts
import { Component, Power } from '@typecad/typecad';

let bt1 = new Component({ footprint: 'Battery:BatteryHolder_Keystone_3008_1x2450' });
// bt1 represents a coin cell battery holder.
// The following Power object defines its output characteristics:
let coin_cell = new Power({
    power: bt1.pin(1), // Pin 1 is the positive terminal
    gnd: bt1.pin(2),   // Pin 2 is the ground terminal
    voltage: 3.7,      // Nominal voltage of 3.7V
    direction: 'output' // Indicates this is a power source
});
```

In this example, `coin_cell` configures `bt1` (a coin cell battery holder) as a power source.
- It specifies `bt1.pin(1)` as the positive terminal and `bt1.pin(2)` as the ground.
- It declares that this source provides a nominal 3.7 volts.
- Because `direction` is set to `output`, typeCAD automatically sets the `type` of `bt1.pin(1)` and `bt1.pin(2)` to `power_out`. This is important for Electrical Rules Checking (ERC).

### Handling `output` and `input` `Power` in Components

Components like voltage regulators often have both power inputs and outputs. For instance, a voltage regulator takes an input voltage and produces a different output voltage.

A common scenario is when the input and output sides of such a component share the same ground pin. If you define separate `Power` objects for the input and output, and both reference the same physical pin as ground, this can lead to ERC conflicts because a pin would be assigned as `power_out` (from the output `Power` object) and potentially `power_in` or another type (from the input `Power` object).

To avoid such ERC errors for a shared ground pin, you can manually set the pin's type to `passive` after the `Power` objects have been defined:

```ts
// Assuming U1 is a voltage regulator component
// and U1.pin(2) is the shared ground pin.

let vin = new Power({ power: U1.pin(1), gnd: U1.pin(2), voltage: 5, direction: 'input' });
let vout = new Power({ power: U1.pin(3), gnd: U1.pin(2), voltage: 3.3, direction: 'output' });

// Manually set the shared ground pin to passive to avoid ERC conflicts
U1.pin(2).type = 'passive';
```

This tells typeCAD that the pin is a common connection point not actively sourcing or sinking power in a way that conflicts with its dual role.

## Input `Power`

Just as components can source power, they often need to receive it. An input `Power` object is used to specify the power requirements for a component or a part of your circuit.

When creating reusable typeCAD packages (e.g., a module for a specific sensor that requires power), you can define a constructor parameter for a `Power` object. This allows users of your package to easily connect a suitable power source.

Inside your package's code, you can then use the properties of this input `Power` object to make connections. For example, if `vin` is an input `Power` object passed to your component, and `U1` is an internal part that needs power:

```ts
// Assuming 'vin' is a Power object passed as a parameter (direction: 'input')
// and U1 is a component within your design that needs power.

// Connect the power line from the input Power object to U1's VCC pin
typecad.net(vin.power, U1.VCC);

// Connect the ground line from the input Power object to U1's GND pin
typecad.net(vin.gnd, U1.GND);
```

By using `vin.power` and `vin.gnd`, you are connecting to the pins that were defined when the input `Power` object (`vin`) was created. This ensures that your component correctly receives power according to its design.

If `direction` is set to `input`, typeCAD will automatically set the `type` of the associated pins to `power_in` for ERC purposes.

### Voltage checks
A package can check that the voltage levels coming in are correct as well. 

```ts
if (vin.voltage != 3.3) {
    throw new Error('Voltage must be 3.3v');
}
```

       Connections

## Project Structure

*Project Structure*

A **type**CAD project is self-contained and looks like this:

```bash
project
├── fw
├── hw
│    └── build
│        └── lib
│            └── footprints
└── src
```

## `fw`
Intended for firmware. If a PlatformIO project is created when you run `npx @typecad/create-typecad`, you can open the `workspace` file to open both the firmware and hardware projects in the same VSCode and have access to their respective build tools.

## `hw`
All the hardware-related files are here.
- `build` holds all the KiCAD files
- `./build/lib` is where KiCAD symbols are stored
- `./build/footprints` is where KiCAD footprints are stored
- `src` is where the TypeScript files are stored

### ⚠️ Important: Component Creation Location
When using `@typecad/add-component`, **always run it from the `hw/` directory**:

```bash
cd hw
npm run add-component
```

Components created in the wrong location will cause import errors because `@typecad/typecad` is only installed in the `hw/` directory.

**Correct structure:**
```
project/
├── hw/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── main.ts          ← your main circuit file
│   │   └── ESP32.ts         ← components go here
│   └── package.json         ← has @typecad/typecad dependency
└── fw/                      ← firmware code
```

## Self-contained
The entire project is contained in the project folder. Symbols, footprints, 3d files, source files, etc. are all in this project folder.

       Classes

---

## Requirements

*Requirements*

Make sure your system has the required software to get started.
- [KiCAD](https://kicad.org/download/) - version **8.0** or later
- [npm/Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) - version **20** or later

> [!WARNING] pio and git in your PATH
> Ensure that `pio` and `git` are in your PATH. **type**CAD optionally uses these commands in its tooling

       Concepts

---

## Tooling

*Tooling*

**type**CAD provides a collection of tools to make the development process easier.

## Project Creation
To create a new project enter the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx @typecad/create-typecad
```

The first time, `npx` will ask you to download the script so it can run it. 

Then you'll be prompted to enter project details:
- name for the project
- if you want to create a PlatformIO project and if so, the [board ID](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/index.html)
- if you want to create a `git` repository
- install optional utility packages

A project will be created in the current directory. Inside the project directory, there will be a VSCode `workspace` file that will open the project in VSCode.

### Non-interactive mode
All the information can be passed by command-line arguments and the script will automatically create a project. `--help` will show all the parameters.

```bash
npx @typecad/create-typecad --name=typecad_project --git=false --pio=false
```

The above is the minimum to run automatically. 

--- 

### Project Use
A **type**CAD project is just an npm package. All the normal npm-based tools are available to you. A `package.json` file is created with access to the following scripts:
- Project Building
- Adding Components
- Opening the `kicad_pcb` file in KiCAD

> [!tip]
> In VSCode, there's a sidebar that allows you to just click the various scripts to run them

### Project Building
Click the `Build` script in VSCode's `NPM Scripts` sidebar. 

To build the project in a terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npx tsx [path/to/file.ts]
```

The outputs will be in `./build/`.

## Adding Components
Components are discussed in the [Components](/docs/components) page. But for now, they are anything with a footprint that you'd add to your PCB like MCUs and resistors.

To add a component to the project:

```bash
npx @typecad/add-component --folder=./src
```

When the script runs, you'll be asked the source for the symbol and footprint files. You can mix any of the sources ie. a KiCAD symbol, but a local file. 
- If it's a KiCAD library component, you'll be prompted to enter the symbol and footprint names
- If it's a local file, you'll be prompted to enter the path to the file
- If it's an EasyEDA/JLCPCB component, you'll be asked for the `C###` number

A `[component].ts` file will be generated along with instructions on how to use it. Files will also be copied into the `./build/` directory.

### Non-interactive mode
All the information can be passed by command-line arguments and the script will automatically create a component. `--help` will show all the parameters.

```bash
  npx @typecad/add-component --symbol_source=kicad --footprint_source=local --symbol=MCU_Microchip_ATtiny:ATtiny3227-M --footprint=MyLib:MyFootprint
  
  npx @typecad/add-component --symbol_source=jlcpcb --footprint_source=kicad --c=C3217148 --footprint=Package_QFN:QFN-32-1EP_5x5mm_P0.5mm_EP3.45x3.45mm
```

The above is the minimum to run automatically.

> [!important]
> There's no need to add passives (resistors, capacitors etc.) this way. See the  [Passives](/docs/passives) page for more information.

## Package Creation
typeCAD has a command-line tool to generate all the boilerplate code for a package. It sets up the package for easy publishing and reuse. It is discussed in more detail in the [Package Overview](/docs/package/overview) page.

Execute the following command in `./hw` of an already existing **type**CAD project.

```bash
npx @typecad/add-package --folder=./src
```

## Troubleshooting

*Troubleshooting*

Common errors and their solutions when working with typeCAD.

## Import and Module Errors

### "Cannot find module '@typecad/typecad'"
**Cause**: Component created in wrong directory or `@typecad/typecad` not installed.

**Solution**: 
1. Ensure you're working in the `hw/` directory
2. Check that `hw/package.json` includes `@typecad/typecad` dependency
3. Run `npm install` in the `hw/` directory

### "Module has no exported member 'Connector'"
**Cause**: Importing from wrong package path.

```ts
// ❌ Wrong
import { Connector } from '@typecad/passives/0603';

// ✅ Correct
import { Connector } from '@typecad/passives/connector';
```

## Connection Errors

### "Property 'connect' does not exist on type 'Pin'"
**Cause**: Using non-existent `.connect()` method.

```ts
// ❌ Wrong
pin1.connect(pin2);

// ✅ Correct
typecad.net(pin1, pin2);
```

### "Property 'pin' does not exist"
**Cause**: Using string-based pin access on components with named pins.

```ts
// ❌ Wrong
esp32.pin('VDD')

// ✅ Correct
esp32.VDD         // or esp32.pin(8) if VDD is pin 8
```

## Component Creation Errors

### "Cannot find name 'ComponentName'"
**Cause**: Component file not imported or created in wrong location.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure component was created with `@typecad/add-component`
2. Check the import statement matches the generated file
3. Verify component file is in `hw/src/` directory

### Component properties not working

```ts
// ❌ Wrong
new Connector({ pins: 3 })

// ✅ Correct
new Connector({ number: 3 })
```

Check the component documentation for correct property names.

## Build Errors

### TypeScript compilation errors
1. Check all imports are correct
2. Ensure all components are properly created with `typecad.create()`
3. Verify pin connections use correct syntax

### KiCAD file generation issues
1. Ensure all components have valid symbols and footprints
2. Check that all nets have at least 2 pins connected
3. Verify component references are unique

## Getting Help

If you're still stuck:
1. Check the [Examples](/examples) for working code patterns
2. Join the [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/typecad/) 
3. Review the [API documentation](/docs) for correct syntax

       What is typeCAD

## What Is Typecad

*What is typeCAD*

##  KiCAD + TypeScript + npm = **type**CAD
> typeCAD is a way to programmatically create hardware designs.

It's done with TypeScript and all the awesomeness of the npm/Node.js ecosystem.

- npm packages can be imported into your projects
- create portable/importable/shareable packages
- semantic version control

The schematic portion of hardware design is replaced with a few simple TypeScript classes. Rather than clicking and dragging, a line of code creates a component, and another line connects it. Sections of code can be turned into reusable modules and those modules can be turned into reusable packages, layout included.

Code can be version controlled, status tracked, git push/pull/PR/issues can be used, and all the typical tools for software design can be used for hardware design now

## Example
This **type**CAD code...

```ts
import { Schematic, Component } from '@typecad/typecad'
import { Resistor, LED } from '@typecad/passives/0805'

let typecad = new Schematic('typecad');
let bt1 = new Component({ footprint: 'BatteryHolder_Keystone_500' });
let r1 = new Resistor({ value: "1 kOhm" });
let d1 = new LED();

typecad.named('vin').net(bt1.pin(1), r1.pin(1));
typecad.net(r1.pin(2), d1.pin(2));
typecad.named('gnd').net(d1.pin(1), bt1.pin(2));

typecad.create(r1, d1, bt1);
```

...is the same as this schematic.

![simple led circuit](https://typecad.net/led-circuit.png)

>The difference is that code can be copied, turned into reusable packages, version controlled, and used within the npm/Node.js system.

## Get started
Read through the [walkthrough](https://typecad.net/docs/walkthrough/get-started) for a quick introduction to the basics.

Wouldn't testing and CI be nice for hardware designs? 

Code can be version controlled, status tracked, git push/pull/PR/issues can be used, and all the typical tools for software design can be used for hardware design now.

```ts
expect(power.minimum).to.be.at.least(3.0);      // check voltage levels
expect(power.maximum).to.be.at.most(3.6);
typecad.erc();                                  // run ERC on every build
``` -->

## Attiny85

*Adding KiCAD Library Components*

**type**CAD is tightly integrated with KiCAD, that means easy access to the installed KiCAD library of parts it comes with. 

### Video

## `add-component`
Using the `Add Component 🧩` NPM script to add a new component is the easiest way. It should be available to just click in the NPM Scripts section in VS Code. There are three sources of components: KiCAD, JLCPCB and local files. Both symbol and footprint files are needed to create a typeCAD component. Any source can be mixed with any other, ie. a KiCAD symbol and a local downloaded footprint. 

Click it and you should see something like the following:

```
🧩 typeCAD Create Component
? Select symbol source: (Use arrow keys)
❯ KiCAD
  local file
  EasyEDA/JLCPCB
A symbol from the installed KiCAD library
```

Choose `KiCAD` for both symbol and footprint source. The next thing it asks is the `Symbol name`. Right now, the easiest way to get that information is to add the part you want to a schematic. For this example, we'll make an ATtiny85 MCU. Open KiCAD's schematic editor and add it to a KiCAD schematic. Select it and press `e`. You should see a dialog that looks like this:

![KiCAD Symbol Properties](/docs/attiny85.png)

The highlighted `Library link` text on the bottom has the information you need. The first part, before the `:` is the symbol library name (`MCU_Microchip_ATtiny`), the second part is the symbol name (`ATtiny85-20S`). KiCAD conveniently lets you copy this text, so copy it and paste it into our terminal.

```
🧩 typeCAD Create Component
✔ Select symbol source: KiCAD
✔ Select footprint source: KiCAD
✔ Symbol name? MCU_Microchip_ATtiny:ATtiny3227-M
? Footprint name? (Package_DFN_QFN:QFN-24-1EP_4x4mm_P0.5mm_EP2.6x2.6mm)
```
The next question asks for the `Footprint name`. For KiCAD components, the default text will contain the symbol-specified footprint file. For some components this might not be what you want, but for this particular component, `Package_DFN_QFN:QFN-20-1EP_4x4mm_P0.5mm_EP2.6x2.6mm` is the right one. Hit enter. Footprints are defined in the sam way as symbols ([footprint_lib:footprint_name]).

```
🧩 typeCAD Create Component
✔ Select symbol source: KiCAD
✔ Select footprint source: KiCAD
✔ Symbol name? MCU_Microchip_ATtiny:ATtiny85-20M
✔ Footprint name? Package_DFN_QFN:QFN-20-1EP_4x4mm_P0.5mm_EP2.6x2.6mm
Finished component creation, use it with:
 import { ATtiny85_20M } from './ATtiny85_20M';
 let u1 = new ATtiny85_20M();
 ```

There will be a little implementation code that shows how to `import` the code and create a `new` instance of it. 

## `import`
The minimal code to use this new component looks like this:

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad'
import { ATtiny85_20M } from './ATtiny85_20M';

let typecad = new PCB('attiny85');
let u1 = new ATtiny85_20M();

typecad.create(u1);
```

---

## Bom

*BOM*

**type**CAD provides a built in BOM export function. 

## Bill-of-Material
**type**CAD can export a CSV file from a `Schematic` object.

```ts
import { Component, PCB, Power } from '@typecad/typecad';
let typecad = new pcb('bom');

// add components

typecad.create();
typecad.bom();
```

The output will be a `bom.csv` in the `./build` folder and will look something like this:

```csv
Reference,Value,Datasheet,Footprint,MPN
U1,,,lib:ESP32S3MINI1N8,C2913206
C3,22uF,,Capacitor_SMD:C_0603_1608Metric,
C4,0.1uF,,Capacitor_SMD:C_0603_1608Metric,
C6,1uF,,Capacitor_SMD:C_0603_1608Metric,
R2,10kΩ,,Resistor_SMD:R_0603_1608Metric,
C1,22uF,,Capacitor_SMD:C_0603_1608Metric,
C2,10uF,,Capacitor_SMD:C_0603_1608Metric,
VR1,,https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/698/REN_isl9120ir_DST_20050421-1998698.pdf,lib:QFN50P300X300X75-13N-D,ISL9120IRTNZ
L1,1uH,https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/281/1/J_E_TE243A_0011-2303275.pdf,lib:1285ASH1R0MP2,1285AS-H-1R0M=P2
BT1,,,Battery:BatteryHolder_Keystone_3008_1x2450,3008TR
```

Each field, `value`, `datasheet`, `footprint`, and `MPN` can all be set for each `Component` object.

## Extending BOM 
**type**CAD is entirely TypeScript, so you can extending or changing the function is simple. You'll want to look at how the BOM function is implemented in [schematic.ts](https://github.com/typecad/typecad/blob/1a63964eece0fc98053e426192e770c35577a14d/schematic.ts#L96).

This is the bulk of the function and is simple to change.

```ts
bom += 'Reference,Value,Datasheet,Footprint,MPN\n';
this.Components.forEach(component => {
	bom += `${component.reference},${component.value},${component.datasheet},${component.footprint},${component.mpn}\n`;
});
```

---

## Erc

*ERC*

**type**CAD provides a built in ERC function. 

## Electrical Rules Checker
**type**CAD replicates the functionality of the KiCAD ERC. After `Schematic::create()` has been called, you can call `Schematic::erc()` and it will check your schematic for any connection errors. 

It uses the same KiCAD basic rules as shown in this picture.

![KiCAD ERC](/examples/erc/kicad-erc.png)
KiCAD includes a lot of other rules, but the majority of them are not relevant to **type**CAD.

Here's a simple example.

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad'

let typecad = new PCB('erc');
typecad.create();
typecad.erc();
```

Assuming no errors, it will show `ERC 0 errors, 0 warnings` in the build output. 

```bash
ERC error: power_in pin VR1:5 not driven by a power_out pin. Use [pin].type = 'power_out' to designate a power_out pin
ERC 1 errors, 0 warnings
```

If an error is found, there will be an error message in the output:

> [!WARNING]
> If ERC returns an error, the build process is stopped. The code under `::erc` will not be executed.

## Pin Types
ERC works primarily by checking pin type against each other. The types are the standard KiCAD pin types: `power_in`, `power_out`, `passive` etc. A `power_in` pin must be connected to a `power_out` pin, for example. 

Pin type are typically set in [component](/docs/components) files, generated by **type**CAD tooling. The information for pin types is taken from the symbol files, but the files are not always correct. Many symbols that come from outside the KiCAD library will have all the types set to `passive`. 

Pin types can be corrected manually in the component files, or they can be set in code like this:

```ts
import { Component } from '@typecad/typecad';
let bt1 = new Component({ footprint: 'Battery:BatteryHolder_Keystone_3008_1x2450', prefix: 'BT', mpn: '3008TR' });

bt1.pin(1).type = 'power_out';
bt1.pin(2).type = 'power_out';
```

This example shows changing a battery holder's pins to `power_out` since they were set to `passive` originally.

## Jig

*Test jig/multi-board creation*

Making a test jig is a common activity when developing a PCB. Using **type**CAD, you can create a test jig and the board you're developing in a single codebase. This is also a demonstration of how multiple PCBs can be created from code as well. 

## Testing jigs
For this example, our board and jig will be:
1. a board with test points on the bottom
2. another board with pogo pins that connect to the test points
3. the boards will connect with standoffs and mounting holes

There's obviously a lot of options here and this is just a simple example of one way it could be done. 

## Make a **type**CAD project
From a terminal, run:

```bash
npx @typecad/create-typecad
```

Call this project `jig`. No need to make a PlatformIO project or initialize a git repo unless you want to. No extra packages are needed either, but feel free to add them later if you want. 

## Code
Add some code which will:
- create a board with two test points and two mounting holes
- create a jig board with two pogo pins and two mounting holes
- add a resistor to pretend to be testing something

```ts
import { PCB } from "@typecad/typecad"
import { Resistor } from '@typecad/passives/0603';
import { MountingHole } from '@typecad/passives/mounting_hole';
import { Testpoint } from '@typecad/passives/testpoint';
import { P70_5000045R } from './P70_5000045R';

let typecad = new PCB('main');

let r1 = new Resistor({ value: '1kohm', pcb: {x: 166.815, y: 86.36, rotation: 0} });
let mh1 = new MountingHole({ size: 'M2.5', pcb: {x: 152.4, y: 76.2, rotation: 0} });
let mh2 = new MountingHole({ size: 'M2.5',  pcb: {x: 177.8, y: 101.6, rotation: 0} });

let tp1 = new Testpoint({  pcb: {x: 165.1, y: 81.28, rotation: 0} });
let tp2 = new Testpoint({  pcb: {x: 168.04, y: 93.98, rotation: 0} });

typecad.create(r1, mh1, mh2, tp1, tp2);

let jig = new PCB('jig');
let pogo1 = new P70_5000045R({  pcb: {x: 165.1, y: 81.28, rotation: 0} });
let pogo2 = new P70_5000045R({  pcb: {x: 168.04, y: 93.98, rotation: 0} });

jig.create(mh1, mh2, pogo1, pogo2);
```

## Code walkthrough

### `import`

```ts
import { PCB } from "@typecad/typecad"
import { Resistor } from '@typecad/passives/0603';
import { MountingHole } from '@typecad/passives/mounting_hole';
import { Testpoint } from '@typecad/passives/testpoint';
import { P70_5000045R } from './P70_5000045R';
```

We import the usual classes, plus a pogo pin from a custom package (_there's a downlink link at the bottom for this whole project_). `MountingHole`, `Testpoint` and `Resistor` are all from the `@typecad/passives` package which should already be installed.

### `PCB`
Now create the two PCBs.

```ts
let typecad = new PCB('main');
let jig = new PCB('jig');
```

Here, we create the main board, and also the jig board.

### Components
Then all the components are created. `mh1`, `mh2` are mounting holes. `tp1`, `tp2` are test points and will go on the main PCB. `pogo1`, `pogo2` are pogo pins and will go on the jig board. 

One important point to see is that the locations are being specified. This will come in handy when we reuse the mounting holes on the jig board. 

Now create the components on the main board.

```ts
pcb.create(r1, mh1, mh2, tp1, tp2);
```

### Jig board components
The last thing to do will be to add the mounting holes and pogo pins to the jig board. Notice that we've copied the xy locations of the test points to the pogo pins. This will ensure that the pogo pins line up with the test points. 

```ts
let pogo1 = new P70_5000045R({  pcb: {x: 165.1, y: 81.28, rotation: 0} });
let pogo2 = new P70_5000045R({  pcb: {x: 168.04, y: 93.98, rotation: 0} });

jig.create(mh1, mh2, pogo1, pogo2);
```

## Build
Build the code and there will be two PCB files created; `main.kicad_pcb` and `jig.kicad_pcb`. You'll see that the mounting holes, testpoints/pogo pins all line up. From here you can add additional functionality as needed. Changes made to one board can be programmatically applied to the other board with just a little bit of code. 

## Downlink
[jig project source](/examples/jig/jig.zip)

Extract the zip file and open `jig.code-workspace` in VSCode. `npm i` to install dependencies.

## Jlcpcb Export

*JLCPCB-Export*

The [@typecad/jlcpcb-export](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typecad/jlcpcb-export) package exports all the assembly files for JLCPCB. 

Install the package in a **type**CAD project:

```ts
npm i @typecad/jlcpcb-export
```

Then `import` it and use it:

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad';
import { jlcpcb_export } from '@typecad/jlcpcb-export';// [!code highlight]

let typecad = new PCB('project');

// all your code

jlcpcb_export(typecad, pcb);// [!code highlight]
```

## Pre-checks
The most appropriate place to run `jlcpcb_export` may not be at the bottom of your code. This would work nicely in a Github CI/CD setup. When an update is pushed, the build files are created. Another option would be running it as a git hook. 

Regardless of where you run it, it will check:
- that the board passes KiCAD's DRC
- that the git repo is clean

If you don't care, you can disable these checks:

`jlcpcb_export(typecad, pcb, true);`

## Output
Several files will be created, with a single zip file ready to upload to JLCPCB.

---

## Ngspice

*ngspice*

One of the benefits of PCB-as-code is it avoids the tediousness of drag-and-drop GUIs. The various spice simulations often require the same drag-and-drop steps and maybe even recreating the PCB. **type**CAD lets you use your code with only very minor changes. 

## Voltage Divider
This example will use the [voltage divider](/examples/voltage-divider) example as a starting point.

This is the circuit:
![Voltage Divider](/examples/voltage-divider/voltage-divider.png)

And this is the code:

```ts
import { PCB } from "@typecad/typecad"
import { Resistor } from '@typecad/passives/0603';

let typecad = new PCB('voltage_divider');
let r1 = new Resistor({ value: '10kohm' });
let r2 = new Resistor({ value: '10kohm' });

typecad.named('vdiv').net(r1.pin(2), r2.pin(1));

typecad.create(r1, r2);
```

## Install `@typecad/ngspice`
First, make sure you have `@typecad/ngspice` installed in your project. From the `./hw` directory, run:

```bash
npm install @typecad/ngspice
```

Then you'll need [ngspice](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/download.html) installed and ensure the binaries are in your `PATH`.

### `Power`
Next, we need to add a `Power` component. In addition to helping with simulation, they assist with ERC (electrical rule checking) by ensuring pins are connected as they should be and packages can use it to determine the power supply voltage is correct. 

```ts
import { PCB } from "@typecad/typecad" // [!code --]
import { PCB, Power } from "@typecad/typecad" // [!code ++][!code word:Power]
import { Resistor } from '@typecad/passives/0603';

let typecad = new PCB('voltage_divider');
let r1 = new Resistor({ value: '10kohm' });
let r2 = new Resistor({ value: '10kohm' });
let vin = new Power({ power: r1.pin(1), gnd: r2.pin(2), voltage: 3.3 });  // [!code highlight]

typecad.named('in').net(r1.pin(1));  // [!code highlight]
typecad.named('vdiv').net(r1.pin(2), r2.pin(1));
typecad.named('gnd').net(r2.pin(2));  // [!code highlight]

typecad.create(r1, r2);
```

In the code above, we added a `Power` object called `vin`. Power is coming in from the top of `R1` and going to the bottom of `R2`. The `voltage` is 3.3 volts. 

A more practical example would be a battery holder with the pins corresponding to the positive and negative terminals, but for this example, we'll use the resistor legs as the power terminals. 

> [!tip]
> `Power` objects represent a physical component like the pins of a battery holder or a voltage regulator. It is not the same as a PCB `VCC` or `GND` symbol that is more abstract. 

Look at lines 10 and 12. You'll see that `vin.power` is connected to `r1.pin(1)` by itself and it is `::named`. `@typecad/ngspice` only pays attention to `::named` nets that have components used in the simulation. nspice will treat each `::named` net as a node and give voltage/power/current measurements for each. 

## Import `ngspice`
Now we need to add the `ngspice` related code. 

```ts
// [!code word:simulation]
import { PCB, Power } from "@typecad/typecad"
import { Resistor } from '@typecad/passives/0603';
import { ngspiceSimulator } from '@typecad/ngspice'; // [!code highlight]

let typecad = new PCB('voltage_divider');
let r1 = new Resistor({ value: '10kohm', simulation: { include: true } }); 
let r2 = new Resistor({ value: '10kohm', simulation: { include: true } }); 
let vin = new Power({ power: r1.pin(1), gnd: r2.pin(2), voltage: 3.3 }); 
let ngspice = new ngspiceSimulator(typecad, vin); // [!code highlight]

typecad.named('vdiv').net(r1.pin(2), r2.pin(1));

typecad.create(r1, r2);
```

This code imports the package. It also adds a `simulation` property to the resistors. This tells `@typecad/ngspice` to include the component in the simulation. Every component has a `simulation` property, setting `include` to `true` will include the component in the simulation. There is an additional property, `model`, that can be used to specify an ngspice model: `{model: '.model Dled D (IS=1a RS=3.3 N=1.8)'`. 

The last thing is to create a `ngspiceSimulator` object. It takes the `PCB` object and all the `Power` objects. In this example, we only have one `Power` object, but if you have multiple, you can pass them all.

## Simulate
Now that our circuit is created, nets are named, we can run the simulation. 

Currently, there are two simulation modes available in the library: DC and transient analysis. 

```ts
import { PCB, Power } from "@typecad/typecad"
import { Resistor } from '@typecad/passives/0603';
import { ngspiceSimulator } from '@typecad/ngspice';

let typecad = new PCB('voltage_divider');
let r1 = new Resistor({ value: '10kohm', simulation: { include: true } }); 
let r2 = new Resistor({ value: '10kohm', simulation: { include: true } }); 
let vin = new Power({ power: r1.pin(1), gnd: r2.pin(2), voltage: 3.3 }); 
let ngspice = new ngspiceSimulator(typecad, vin);

typecad.named('vdiv').net(r1.pin(2), r2.pin(1));

typecad.create(r1, r2);

ngspice.op(); // [!code highlight]
```

When the project is built, the output will be in the console:

```bash
🌶️ Running ngspice
┌────────────────────┬───────────────┬────────────────────┐
│ Variable           │ Type          │ Value              │
├────────────────────┼───────────────┼────────────────────┤
│ r1:power           │ power         │ 2.7225 mW          │
├────────────────────┼───────────────┼────────────────────┤
│ v(in)              │ voltage       │ 3.3000 V           │
├────────────────────┼───────────────┼────────────────────┤
│ i(r1)              │ current       │ 1.6500 mA          │
├────────────────────┼───────────────┼────────────────────┤
│ i(r2)              │ current       │ 1.6500 mA          │
├────────────────────┼───────────────┼────────────────────┤
│ r2:power           │ power         │ 2.7225 mW          │
├────────────────────┼───────────────┼────────────────────┤
│ i(v1)              │ current       │ -1.6500 mA         │
├────────────────────┼───────────────┼────────────────────┤
│ v(vdiv)            │ voltage       │ 1.6500 V           │
└────────────────────┴───────────────┴────────────────────┘
```

Each node will be displayed with calculated voltage. ngspice doesn't list ground nodes. Each included component will be displayed with power and current. The final bit will be information about the power supply. In this example, `v1` supplies 1.65 mA of current to the circuit.

### Transient
This example won't show any variance, but you can run a transient analysis. 

Add `ngspice.tran('1us', '100ms');` to the end of the file and ngspice's graphing windows will open for all the nodes and components when the project is built. `tran` takes all the same arguments as ngspice's `tran` command, as described in the [ngspice documentation](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs/ngspice-manual.pdf), section 11.3.10.

## Continuing development
This package covers the basic functionality of basic components. Future development will include the ability to use ngspice library files, additional power source options, and more analysis types.

## Packages

*Adding typeCAD Packages*

**type**CAD is just code and code can be easily packaged and distributed. Read more about them at their [doc](/docs/package/overview) page, but quickly they allow for easy packaging/installation/reuse of blocks of code. A particularly useful thing is implementing a particular IC, including all the passives, connections, and tracks to use it. The result is simply importing packages and connecting them together. 

### Video

Since a package is entirely defined by the package itself and what it does, there is no _one way_ to use them, so each package comes with its own documentation. 

## `@typecad/rd-bq24210`
There is a [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typecad/rd-bq24210) available that implements the [bq24210](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq24210.pdf), a solar-powered battery charger. Let's add it to an existing project.

### `npm i`
Run `npm i @typecad/rd-bq24210` in your project's `./hw` directory. It will install all the required files including KiCAD symbols, footprints and 3d models into the project's `./build/lib` directory. 

> [!WARNING]
> When using any `npm` command, ensure it is entered in the `./hw` directory, at the same level as the `package.json` file is. If it is given in another folder, it either won't work, or will create a bunch of unwanted folders. 

### `import`
The package's page gives implementation code:

```ts
import { rd_bq24210 } from '@typecad/rd-bq24210';
```

### `new`
Create a new instance:

```ts
...
let charger = new rd_bq24210({ 
  chargeCurrentMa: 500,
  temperatureMonitoring: true,
  pcb: typecad 
});
...
```
According to the package documentation, there are a couple things that can be configured in this step: the charging current and using temperature monitoring. 

Charging current is determined by a simple formula that results in a resistor value connected to the IC, the package does the calculations and returns a resistor value to provide the specified current. 

### `create`
The package has a property, `::components` which includes all `create`-able elements. This can be passed to your `PCB::create()` method using the [spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) operator.

```ts
...
typecad.create(...charger.components);
...
```

### Additional connections
This particular IC needs a solar panel and a battery connected to it as explained in the documentation. 

## Layout
Build the project, open the PCB and you will find the package: components, connections, and tracks grouped together. You can drag it around your board and route tracks to it as needed.

## Voltage Divider

*Make a Voltage Divider in **type**CAD*

In this example, we will make a voltage divider. 

This is the equivalent circuit:
![Voltage Divider](/examples/voltage-divider/voltage-divider.png)

Very simple, just two resistors. Voltage on the top, ground on the bottom, with half the voltage in the middle. 

### Video

## Make a **type**CAD project
From a terminal, run:

```bash
npx @typecad/create-typecad
```

Call this project `voltage_divider`. No need to make a PlatformIO project or initialize a git repo unless you want to. No extra packages are needed either, but feel free to add them later if you want. 

Like the output said, open `voltage_divider.code-workspace` in VSCode to get started. You should see `NPM Scripts` in the sidebar with a few scripts. If you don't, click `View > Open View >` and enter `NPM Scripts`. 

### Test build
Click the `🤖 Build` script and you should see some build output in a terminal. If everything is [installed](/docs/requirements) correctly, you should be able to build the project without any errors.

The `r1` resistor is there as test code. It, and the rest of the code, is contained in `./src/voltage-divider.ts`. 

## Making resistors
You can delete most of the starter code in `voltage_divider.ts` so you're left with this:

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad'
import { Resistor } from '@typecad/passives/0603';

let typecad = new PCB('voltage_divider');
let r1 = new Resistor({ value: '1kohm' });

typecad.create(r1);
```

This code creates a `PCB` object called `typecad` and a `Resistor` object called `r1`. We need two resistors, so let's make another.

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad'
import { Resistor } from '@typecad/passives/0603';

let typecad = new PCB('voltage_divider');
let r1 = new Resistor({ value: '1kohm' });
let r2 = new Resistor({ value: '1kohm' }); // [!code ++]

typecad.create(r1, r2); // [!code ++]
```

Don't forget to add `r2` to the `create` method.

### `@typecad/passives`
Most passives can be added in this way. For all the documentation, visit the [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typecad/passives) page. Resistors, capacitors, inductors, fuses, diodes and LEDs in various sizes can be made this way. Connectors and testpoints are also in the package. 

### Resistor properties
Components have several properties, the one we're concerned with here is `value` (VSCode tooltips will tell you all the other properties). Our example schematic used 10kOhm resistors, so let's change that.

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad'
import { Resistor } from '@typecad/passives/0603';

let typecad = new PCB('voltage_divider');
let r1 = new Resistor({ value: '10kohm' }); // [!code ++]
let r2 = new Resistor({ value: '10kohm' }); // [!code ++]

typecad.create(r1, r2);
```

## Build
Build the schematic again. Click the `✳️ Open Board` script. When KiCAD opens you should see two resistors on the board. 

> [!TIP]
> To see the changes in your code in KiCAD, use the `Revert` menu item in `File`. You may want to hotkey this function since you'll be using it a lot with typeCAD. 

## Connections
To create our voltage divider, we need to connect our two resistors together. 

### ❌ Common Mistake
**Don't try to use `.connect()` - it doesn't exist:**

```ts
// ❌ This will NOT work
r1.pin(2).connect(r2.pin(1));  // Error: connect() doesn't exist
```

### ✅ Correct Way
For passive components, use `component.pin(number)` to get a `Pin` object, then use `typecad.net()` to connect them:

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad'
import { Resistor } from '@typecad/passives/0603';

let typecad = new PCB('voltage_divider');
let r1 = new Resistor({ value: '10kohm' });
let r2 = new Resistor({ value: '10kohm' });

typecad.net(r1.pin(2), r2.pin(1));// [!code ++]

typecad.create(r1, r2);
```

If we want, we can give this connection a name so it is clearer in KiCAD. 

```ts
typecad.net(r1.pin(2), r2.pin(1));// [!code --]
typecad.named('vdiv').net(r1.pin(2), r2.pin(1));// [!code ++]
```

## Build again
When you build again, you'll see the connection we just made inside KiCAD.

## Power
We need to add a power source to make something happen. A `Power` object represents a physical source of power in **type**CAD. Don't think of it like the VCC or GND symbol in a schematic, but more like a power regulator or battery as it would be in your PCB; it has pins and is an actual component. For this simple example, the pins will be the top of `R1` and the bottom of `R2`. In a more practical example, the pins of a `Power` object would be a voltage regulator, battery holder, or similar source. 

```ts
import { PCB, Power } from "@typecad/typecad" // [!code ++]
import { Resistor } from '@typecad/passives/0603';

let typecad = new PCB('voltage_divider');
let r1 = new Resistor({ value: '10kohm' });
let r2 = new Resistor({ value: '10kohm' });
let vcc = new Power({ power: r1.pin(1), gnd: r2.pin(2), voltage: 5.0 }); // [!code ++]

typecad.named('vdiv').net(r1.pin(2), r2.pin(1));

typecad.create(r1, r2);
```

There won't be anything to see after this change from with KiCAD.

## What is typeCAD?

typeCAD is a modern hardware design platform that brings the power of TypeScript to electronic design. It allows you to:

- Create modular, reusable hardware designs
- Version control your hardware designs using git
- Generate production-ready outputs for manufacturing
- Collaborate with other designers using familiar development tools

## Quick Start

1. **Install Node.js**
- Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- Verify installation by running `node --version` in your terminal

2. **Create Your First Project**
   ```bash
   npx @typecad/create-typecad
   ```
3. **Start Designing**
- Open the project in VS Code
- Begin creating your hardware design using TypeScript
- `build` your code to generate outputs

4. **Layout in KiCAD**
  - Open the `kicad_pcb` file in the `./build` folder
  - Your components and connections will be there
  - If you make changes in typeCAD, you can see them by clicking `File > Revert`. 

## Next Steps
- Start with making a simple [voltage divider circuit](/examples/voltage-divider)
- Read [Connections](/docs/connections) to understand how to connect components

We've just released [typecad-docgen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typecad/typecad-docgen) to automate the generation of KiCAD documentation from markdown files. This works nicely with the other command-line tools we've released.
- [wiring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typecad/wiring) - Programmatically create wiring diagrams
- [typecad-gitdiff](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typecad/typecad-gitdiff) - See the differences between KiCAD PCB files  

Using those tools along with typeCAD means a huge portion of the workflow can be automated and also easily integrated into your CI/CD pipeline.

**type**CAD is meant to work closely with KiCAD, essentially replacing the schematic editor. But **type**CAD can do a lot more than the schematic editor so the best way to go about things was getting a bit hazy. 

## The Problem
The vast majority of PCB design and layout can be done with **type**CAD now. But there are still some things that KiCAD is better at and the best way to sync changes between moving parts in the editor versus what's generated by code wasn't clear. 

## The Solution
Nearly everything can have its state saved and **type**CAD is smart enough to figure out what needs to be updated and what should be left as you manually edited it. 

## Some Improvements

### Saving over KiCAD changes
**type**CAD used to check for a lock file to see if the PCB file was open in KiCAD. It worked, but it wasn't great. Now, it does some fancy window title checking, finds the open KiCAD window and checks for unsaved changes. The build process will stop and let you know and let you save (or not) before proceeding. If you're on a system that doesn't support this (Mac?), it will just check for the lock file. 

### Tracks
Tracks can have their widths changed in KiCAD, but not deleted. **type**CAD will recreate deleted tracks, so if you want to modify a track, if it it created in code, it needs to be deleted in code (delete the line). 

Preserved track changes are displayed during the build process, so you are made aware of any deviations from what the code as supposed to make. 

### Components
Components can be moved and rotated in KiCAD. **type**CAD will preserve those changes. Nearly anything you can do with components in KiCAD will be preserved. 

### Vias
Vias can be created in **type**CAD, so if you make any in KiCAD, the build process will let you know about them and give the coordinates so you can add them to your code. 

## The End Result
The goal is to have a smooth workflow between KiCAD and **type**CAD. You should be able to make changes in either if you choose, while nudging in the direction of **type**CAD for declaratively creating a PCB.

Version 0.1.2 of [typeCAD](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typecad/typecad) was just released with major layout improvements. Before there were significant limitations on what was possible with it. Before, when a layout was applied, it moved all the components to whatever location specified in the typeCAD code. This worked well enough as an MVP, but wasn't a great developer experience. 

Now with this new release, that has been fixed. To keep the components from moving around, they just need to be given a UUID:

```ts
this.C1 = new Capacitor({ value: '10uF', uuid: '6d588378-32ea-4e85-a943-d9b373a3d454' });
```

There are several VS Code extensions that can help with the generation. [Here's one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=netcorext.uuid-generator). 

## Other improvements
There were also improvements in BOM generation. Fields can be customized in typeCAD code.

The standard is defined at at their website: [llms-txt](https://llmstxt.org/). Basically, it is a way to document projects for easy use with AI. 

## Example use

Most any LLM model allows file usage; download [`/llms-full.txt`](/llms-full.txt), provide it to your LLM, then ask it anything about **type**CAD. It should have the entire website and API available as a source of information. 

Embed [`/llms-full.txt`](/llms-full.txt) into a vector database and create your own agents. [Langflow](https://www.langflow.org/) or [Flowise](https://flowiseai.com/) work well for this. A scraper could also be used to download all the markdown files for more specific or fine-tuned approaches.

**type**CAD can now check for power issues as you develop your circuits. 

## Current carrying tracks
When creating tracks, you can pass a `powerInfo` object that includes the current the track will carry. **type**CAD will check that the track is wide enough to handle the current. 

```ts
let track = pcb.track()
    .powerInfo({ current: 1.0, maxTempRise: 10, thickness: 35 });
    .from({x: 100, y: 100}, "F.Cu", 0.2)
    .to({x: 110, y: 100})
    .to({x: 110, y: 120, layer: "B.Cu"})
```

Using the above code, **type**CAD will check that the track is wide enough to handle 1 amp of current for the specified temperature rise and copper thickness. 

If not, it will throw an error during build. Like this:

```
[TrackBuilder] ERROR: Track width 0.2mm is too narrow for 1A current on F.Cu. Minimum width should be 0.300mm.
```

This works for any segment of track and it is automatically done during every build. You don't need to have a separate calculator and manually check each track segment. 

## Current carrying vias
Vias can be created with the optional `powerInfo` object. This allows **type**CAD to check that the current draw through the via is within the limits of the via's rating using the IPC-2221 standard. `maxTempRise` is the maximum wanted rise in temperature of the via, default is 10 C. `thickness` is the thickness of the via's copper in microns. 35 is the default (1 oz).

```ts
let via = pcb.via({
  at: { x: 10, y: 10 },
  size: 0.6,
  drill: 0.3,
  powerInfo: { current: 3, maxTempRise: 10, thickness: 35 },
});
```

Using the above code, **type**CAD will check that the via is large enough to handle 1 amp of current for the specified temperature rise and copper thickness. 

If not, it will throw an error during build. Like this:

```
[PCB VIA] ERROR: Via size 0.6mm (drill 0.3mm) is too small for 3A current. Maximum capacity is 2.75A @ 10°C rise
```

This also works automatically during every build. 

## Connecting power aware tracks, vias and pins
**type**CAD also now allows for `powerInfo` objects to be attached to pins of components. This allows for checking proper voltage levels and current draw between components and the nets they are connected to. 

- If you try to connect a device that draws 1 Amp, but only power it with a 0.8 Amp power supply, you'll see an error.
- If you try to connect a 5V device to a 3.3V power supply, you'll see an error.
- and many more issues are detected

This all happens automatically during every build. 

## Taking advantage of programmatic circuit design
This is a good example of taking full advantage of programming concepts for circuit design.

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a great way to share your work with the world, but sometimes you may want to keep your work private or have more control over it. 

In those case, you can use [npm private packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-private-packages). You have to pay $7 per month per user. You can create private packages and publish them to your own private registry.

## Private Registry
Maybe you have a server that you can use. If so, you can use [verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/) to create your own private registry.

It's just a single command to install and run. And using it is equally simple, just add a `--registry [server address]` to your `npm install` or `npm publish` command.

A schematic file isn't needed since typeCAD code takes the place of it, but it can be useful to have one available. People will likely still want to look at a schematic rather than code. 

To provide a starting point for that, we've developed a package to do that.

## Simplification

---

**type**CAD was growing in features at the expense of simplicity. The entire API has been simplified and the interaction between KiCAD and typeCAD has been improved while also maintaining backwards compatibility. 

## `Schematic` and `PCB`
The `Schematic` and `PCB` classes have been merged into a single `PCB` class. The `PCB` class now has a `schematic` property that contains the schematic data. The `PCB` class also has a `create` method that takes a list of components and adds them to the schematic and board. This change was made because the schematic and board are always created together and there was no need to have two separate classes. Also, **type**CAD was the schematic, so why put any mental effort into another 'Schematic'?

Now the bare minimum code to create a board is:

```ts
import { PCB } from '@typecad/typecad';
let typecad = new PCB('typecad');
typecad.create();
```

There's no need to think about `Schematic` anymore. All the functionality is still there, but it's stubbed out in the `PCB` class. `::net` and `::named` are called from `PCB` now. So is `::bom` and `::erc`.

## KiCAD
The interaction between **type**CAD and KiCAD was getting unintuitive. Wondering if you needed to Revert to see component location changes or reimport the netlist to see other updates was confusing. 

Now, **type**CAD will automatically import the netlist after running `PCB::create()`. That means you never have to interact with the netlist file again. 

Any changes made to the board will be reflected in their entirety when you run `PCB::create()` and use the Revert function (or just reopen) the board in KiCAD. 

### More KiCAD integration to come
Soon, we'll be releasing a new version that will check for a dirty .kicad_pcb file and prompt you to revert before running `PCB::create()`. This will prevent any changes you've made in KiCAD from being lost. It will be more robust and useful that the current method which just checks for the existence of a lock file. 

## Package improvement
We've tweaked things to make packages easier to create and use. They are now created similarly to other components, and also used the same as well. Before, our example packages had `add` and `place` methods. Now, they have a property that holds everything in a `components` array. That array is passed to `PCB::create()` as a spread operator. The result is a much simpler and more intuitive package creation and use. 

## `npm update` 
Update your projects and packages to the latest version to get the latest features and improvements.

---

One of the last parts of board design was routing and that is largely accomplished now with the newest release. 

## `TrackBuilder`
The `TrackBuilder` object lets you create tracks with a fluent API.

```ts
import { PCB, TrackBuilder } from '@typecad/typecad';

let pcb = new PCB('typecad_docs');

let power_track: TrackBuilder = this.pcb.track()
    .from({x: 100, y: 100}, "F.Cu", 0.2)    // Start on F.Cu, 0.2mm wide (these are the defaults and can be omitted)
    .to({x: 110, y: 100})                   // go to 110, 100
    .via({size: 0.8, drill: 0.4})           // create a via at the 110, 100
    .to({x: 110, y: 120, layer: "B.Cu"});   // Continues on B.Cu

pcb.group('typecad_docs', power_track);     // add the TrackBuilder to the group

pcb.create();
```

This method fits in nicely with the rest of the **type**CAD API. 

### Connections
`TrackBuilder` objects don't take any connection information. This is because KiCAD will connect any track that touches an element with a net, ie. a track that touches a pad connected to the 'gnd' net will make the entire track also connected to the 'gnd' net. Since there's no use for an unconnected track, this simplifies to process.

## typecad/kicad2typecad
[@typecad/kicad2typecad](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typecad/kicad2typecad) is a package to simplify making tracks. This is particularly useful for making packages. You can lay out the entire package in KiCAD; components placed, tracks drawn, and vias added. Then use `kicad2typecad` to generate the code snippets to create them programmatically in the package. 

### Making a package
The workflow for creating a reusable package is:
1. Create a package, add components and connections
2. Layout the board in KiCAD using tracks and vias
3. Use `kicad2typecad` to generate the code snippets
4. Add the code snippets to the package

An example output for a small package looks like this:

```bash
Reading from File: .\typecad_docs.kicad_pcb
Found 6 segments. Generating TrackBuilder chains from File: .\Reading from File: .\typecad_docs.kicad_pcb.

--- Generated typeCAD TrackBuilder Code from File: .\typecad_docs.kicad_pcb ---

### Using the code
The `TrackBuilder` objects can be used within a package directly. That's why they are prefixed with `this`. One modification would be to place the return value of each `this.pcb.track` into a `TrackBuilder` object which can then be used to place in a package group. 

The vias can also be used directly, or you can just take their location data. 

For `Component` objects, the package doesn't read your code so it doesn't know what the variable names for your components are. It just uses the reference to show the code snippet.

## passives

*typeCAD Passives*

This is a typeCAD package that includes simple access to many passive components.

## Package Import Reference

| Component Type | Package | Import Example |
|----------------|---------|----------------|
| Resistors, Capacitors, LEDs, Diodes | `@typecad/passives/0603` | `import { Resistor, Capacitor } from '@typecad/passives/0603'` |
| Same components, different sizes | `@typecad/passives/0805` | `import { Resistor, Capacitor } from '@typecad/passives/0805'` |
| Connectors | `@typecad/passives/connector` | `import { Connector } from '@typecad/passives/connector'` |
| Test Points | `@typecad/passives/testpoint` | `import { Testpoint } from '@typecad/passives/testpoint'` |
| Core typeCAD classes | `@typecad/typecad` | `import { PCB, Power, Component } from '@typecad/typecad'` | 

## Resistors, capacitors, LEDs, diodes, fuses, and inductors
This package uses an options interface. Any parameter can be included or left out. They can be accessed and modified later in code. 

```ts
import { Schematic } from '@typecad/typecad'
import { Resistor, LED, Capacitor, Diode, Inductor, Fuse } from '@typecad/passives/0805'
import  *  as _0603 from '@typecad/passives/0603'

let typecad = new Schematic('passives');

let resistor = new Resistor({ reference: "R1", value: "4.7 kOhm" });
let capacitor = new Capacitor({value: "100 nF", voltage: "6 V"});
let diode = new Diode();
let inductor = new Inductor({ value: "2.2 uH"});
let fuse = new Fuse({ reference: "F1" });
let led = new _0603.LED();      // a 0603 instead of 0805

typecad.create(resistor, led, capacitor, inductor, diode, fuse);
```
All of the sizes are:
- `@typecad/passives/1210`
- `@typecad/passives/1206`
- `@typecad/passives/0805`
- `@typecad/passives/0603`
- `@typecad/passives/0402`
- `@typecad/passives/0201` **no fuses*

### Auto designation
If `{ reference }` is not included, the component will be auto-numbered. If there are any name collisions, the new name will be suffixed with a `_1`, ie `R1_1`. 

## Connectors
Connectors can be created similarly.

```ts
import { Connector } from './module/passives/connector'

// create a 10-pin connector using the JST footprint passed in the last parameter
let j1 = new Connector({ number: 10, footprint:"Connector_JST:JST_SH_SM10B-SRSS-TB_1x10-1MP_P1.00mm_Horizontal" });
// create a 5-pin connector using a default 2.54 mm pin-header
let j2 = new Connector({ number: 5 });
```

## Testpoints
Testpoints can be created:

```ts
import { Testpoint } from '@typecad/passives/testpoint';
let tp = new Testpoint();
```
Will create a testpoint with a default footprint of `TestPoint:TestPoint_Pad_D1.0mm`.

Specific footprints can be chosen:

```ts
let tp = new Testpoint({ footprint: 'TestPoint:TestPoint_Keystone_5015_Micro_Mini'});
```

Connect a testpoint using `tp.pin(1)` in the `::net()` method.
